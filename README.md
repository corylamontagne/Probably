# Probably-Inerpreter-CPP
Probabilistic esolang

Probably intepreter written in C++.

Probably is a "useless" esolang. The idea behind it being a language that is probabilistic in nature.
Most commands have a percentage chance of failure or executing an a defined inverse of that command.
In addition, there are probability gates that increase and decrease probabilities at the cost of probabilities for future commands.

I thought it would be interesting to code golf with probabilties. Instead of saying I wrote this function in 24 characters can you beat me? The idea was, "I wrote this function that has an 87% chance to do this thing, can you beat me?"
